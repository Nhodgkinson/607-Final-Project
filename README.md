# 607-Final-Project


Hungarian physician, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, collected trial data over a 5 year period in a Vienna hospital on birthing mortality ratios and handwashing. A later project on Datacamp asks students to visualize and show within a 95%CI that doctors who did not wash hands had a higher proportion of mortalities. We want to expand on this and include data captured by UNICEF for handwashing in hospitals across the world and maternal mortality rates by country. We expect to see higher mortality rates in countries where hospitals have less access to handwashing facilities and lower mortality rates in countries with greater access. With the Datacamp project as a guide, we plan on creating a MongoDB, expand the code to analyze new data, compare results, and fail to reject or reject the null hypothesis (# of handwashing facilities has no effect on mortality rates).
